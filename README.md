# RLEnvVizDoom

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/RLEnvVizDoom.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/RLEnvVizDoom.jl)

This package provides a wrapper around the [ViZDoom](https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom) and also some typical scenarios. Enjoy it!

## How to install

This package has only been tested on Ubuntu with Julia 0.7.0(and nightly). You need to install the necessary [dependencies](https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom/blob/master/doc/Building.md#-linux) first (or, you can also check the [packages](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/RLEnvVizDoom.jl/blob/master/.travis.yml) in the `.travis.yml` file). Then just add this package as usual:

```
(v0.7) pkg> add https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/RLEnvVizDoom.jl
```
